# My Shell

Implementation of a terminal/shell in C,made to learn processes, system-calls and signals, and to apply them.

Features I've tried to implement:
> Normal commands and commands like cd
> adding a & to the end of the command makes the process run in background
> multiple commands seperated by '&&' run serially and '&&&' run in parallel.
> CTRL+C stops all the foreground processes
> 'exit' command closes the shell
